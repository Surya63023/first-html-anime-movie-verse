      <strong>Plot:</strong>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Demon Slayer Corps leader Kagaya Ubuyashiki and his wife Amane visits a
        graveyard where fallen Demon Slayers are buried. Lamenting those who
        died in the war against Muzan Kibutsuji, he declares that the human
        spirit will always rise to the challenge. Tanjiro Kamado, his demon
        sister Nezuko, and his friends Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira
        board the Mugen Train to assist Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku in finding
        a demon onboard.[N 1] When two demons appear, Kyojuro kills them and
        they are awed by his power and skill. Later, all of them fall into a
        deep sleep, the work of Enmu, Lower Rank One of Muzan's Twelve Kizuki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enmu instructs four insomniac passengers to enter their dreams and
        destroy their spiritual cores, in exchange for a peaceful sleep. The
        Demon Slayers have idealistic dreams; Tanjiro reunites with his deceased
        family, Kyojuro reminisces on his past with his brother and father,
        Zenitsu envisions a life with Nezuko, and Inosuke imagines himself as a
        leader. The intruders fail to destroy their cores, while Tanjiro, aided
        by the unaffected Nezuko, realizes that he is dreaming. He abandons his
        family and wakes up when a vision of his father instructs him to commit
        suicide. Nezuko uses her pyrokinetic Blood Demon Art to sever the
        intruders' connection to the others. Angered at being denied their own
        dreams, they attack Tanjiro, who knocks them unconscious except his
        intruder, after he refused to harm him despite suffering from
        tuberculosis. While Nezuko wakes up the others, Tanjiro confronts and
        beheads Enmu, but he is revealed to have fused with the train and
        prepares to devour the passengers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kyojuro instructs Inosuke and Tanjiro to cut Enmu's neck as he, Nezuko,
        and Zenitsu protects the passengers. They find it in the locomotive but
        are attacked by its defenses, including a Blood Demon Art that puts them
        to sleep. The conductor, under Enmu's control, stabs Tanjiro in his
        stomach amidst the chaos. With his mask making him immune to Emnu's
        attacks, Inosuke exposes his vertebra. Tanjiro slashes it with his
        newfound Hinokami Kagura, killing Enmu and derailing the train. As
        Tanjiro attempts to recover from his wound, Kyojuro teaches him how to
        stabilize it with his breathing techniques. They are then confronted by
        Upper Rank Three Akaza, who tries to persuade Kyojuro into becoming a
        demon. Kyojuro refuses and fights Akaza, but he cannot overcome his
        regeneration and is severely wounded as Tanjiro and Inosuke look on.
        After attempting his most powerful move as a last resort, Akaza fatally
        injures him by impaling his solar plexus. With his remaining strength,
        Kyojuro attempts to restrain Akaza until sunrise and sever his neck, but
        Akaza breaks free and flees into a nearby forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tanjiro throws his sword at Akaza and impales his chest, though he
        escapes. He breaks down, calling the demon a coward and declaring
        Kyojuro victorious for fulfilling his duty to keep everyone safe. In his
        last moments, Kyojuro tells Tanjiro to visit his family's estate to
        ascertain writings from the past Flame Hashiras, which may help him
        learn about his Hinokami Kagura. He encourages Tanjiro and his friends
        to continue on their paths to greater strength, telling them to never
        give up in protecting others, before succumbing to his injuries and
        reuniting with his mother in the afterlife. While Tanjiro and his
        friends mourn Kyojuro's death, the Hashira receive the news. Kagaya
        honors him for not letting anyone else die in his presence, stating that
        he will be glad to reunite with him when he too passes.

        >, <mark>earned around $395 million worldwide</mark>. It held the title

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spirited Away</strong> is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy film
        written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It was produced by Toshio
        Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli, and distributed by Toho.[7] The film
        stars Rumi Hiiragi, alongside Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki, Takashi Naito,
        Yasuko Sawaguchi, Tsunehiko Kamij≈ç, Takehiko Ono, and Bunta Sugawara. It
        follows a young girl named Chihiro "Sen" Ogino, who moves to a new
        neighborhood and inadvertently enters the world of kami (spirits of
        Japanese Shinto folklore).[8] After her parents are turned into pigs by
        the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to
        find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human
        world. Miyazaki wrote the screenplay after he decided the film would be
        based on the ten-year-old daughter of his friend Seiji Okuda, the film's
        associate producer, who came to visit his house each summer.[9] At the
        time, Miyazaki was developing two personal projects, but they were
        rejected. With a budget of US$19 million, production of Spirited Away
        began in 2000. Pixar animator John Lasseter, a fan and friend of
        Miyazaki, convinced Walt Disney Pictures to buy the film's North
        American distribution rights, and served as executive producer of its
        English-dubbed version.[10] Lasseter then hired Kirk Wise as director
        and Donald W. Ernst as producer, while screenwriters Cindy and Donald
        Hewitt wrote the English-language dialogue to match the characters'
        original Japanese-language lip movements.

      <strong>Plot:</strong>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents Akio and Y≈´ko travel to their
        new home. Akio, taking a shortcut, stops in front of a tunnel leading to
        what appears to be an abandoned resort town, which Y≈´ko insists on
        exploring over Chihiro's protestations. Upon finding a seemingly empty
        restaurant stocked with food, Chihiro's parents immediately begin to
        eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an enormous bathhouse and
        meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed
        before sunset. However, spirits begin to appear, and Chihiro discovers
        that her parents have been transformed into pigs and that she cannot
        cross the now-flooded river. Haku finds Chihiro and instructs her to ask
        for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a y≈çkai spirit
        commanding soot sprites known as susuwatari. Kamaji instead asks a
        worker named Lin to bring Chihiro to Kamaji's master Yubaba, the witch
        who runs the bathhouse and who cursed Chihiro's parents. Yubaba tries to
        frighten Chihiro away but eventually gives her a work contract. As
        Chihiro signs the contract with her name (ÂçÉÂ∞ã), Yubaba takes away the
        second kanji in her name, renaming her Sen (ÂçÉ). She soon forgets her
        real name, and Haku later explains that Yubaba controls people by taking
        their names; if Chihiro completely forgets hers like he once did, she
        will never be able to leave the spirit world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other workers, except for Kamaji and Lin, frequently mock Sen. While
        working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing
        him to be a customer. The spirit of a polluted river arrives as Sen's
        first customer. After she cleans him, he gives her a magic emetic
        dumpling as a token of gratitude. Meanwhile, No-Face demands food from
        the bathhouse workers, granting gold copied from the river spirit in
        exchange. However, when Sen declines the gold and leaves to find Haku,
        No-Face angrily swallows some workers. Sen sees paper shikigami spirits
        attacking a dragon and recognizes the dragon as a metamorphosed Haku.
        When the seriously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen
        follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back
        shapeshifts into Yubaba's twin sister Zeniba, who turns Yubaba's son,
        Boh, into a mouse and creates a false copy of him. Zeniba tells Sen that
        Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from her that carries a deadly
        curse. Haku strikes the shikigami, causing Zeniba to vanish. Sen and
        Haku fall into the boiler room, where she feeds him part of the emetic
        dumpling. He vomits up the seal and a slug that a disgusted Sen kills.
        Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. She confronts
        an engorged No-Face and feeds him the rest of the dumpling, forcing him
        to regurgitate the workers. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse,
        and Lin helps them leave. Sen, No-Face, and Boh travel to see Zeniba
        using train tickets from Kamaji. Meanwhile, Yubaba nearly orders Sen's
        parents slaughtered, but Haku reveals Boh is missing and offers to
        retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and her parents. Yubaba agrees, but
        only if Sen can pass a final test.
      </p>
      <p>
        The train crosses a sea to a land where Sen meets Zeniba, who reveals
        that Yubaba used the slug to control Haku. Zeniba tells Sen that she
        can't help her parents, but she makes her a magic protective hairband.
        Using his dragon form, Haku flies Sen and Boh back, while No-Face
        decides to stay with Zeniba. Mid-flight, Sen recalls falling into the
        Kohaku River years earlier and being washed safely ashore, correctly
        guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of the Kohaku River and
        restoring his memory. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba tests
        Sen, asking her to identify her parents among a group of pigs. After she
        answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract
        disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the
        now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the
        riverbed to her restored parents. Shortly before leaving for her new
        home, Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, still wearing her hairband from
        Zeniba.

      <p>
        Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school student in Itomori,[note 1] a rural
        town in the Gifu prefecture of central Japan. Having grown bored of her
        provincial life, she wishes to be reborn as a boy from Tokyo. Soon,[c]
        she begins to intermittently switch bodies with Taki Tachibana, a high
        school student (and part-time waiter) from Tokyo's ward of Shinjuku. On
        certain days, Taki and Mitsuha wake up in each other's bodies and must
        live the entire day as the other, reverting when they sleep. The two set
        up ground rules for sharing their bodies, communicating via writing
        messages on paper, their phones, and their skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's
        body) sets Taki up on a date with his coworker, Miki Okudera, while Taki
        (in Mitsuha's body) helps Mitsuha become more popular at school. While
        in Mitsuha's body, Taki accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and
        younger sister Yotsuha to a Shinto shrine in the Goshintai[note 2]
        crater near Itomori,[d] leaving an offering of kuchikamizake fermented
        with Mitsuha's saliva. Hitoha explains that God is sovereign over both
        time and the connections between humans. Mitsuha informs Taki[e] that
        the comet Tiamat is expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the
        autumn festival. The next day,[f] Taki goes on a date (at the National
        Art Center in Roppongi) with Okudera in his own body; Okudera enjoys the
        date but says she can tell Taki is preoccupied with someone else, owing
        to his unusual behavior. Realizing he is falling for Mitsuha,[g] Taki
        attempts to dial her number, but cannot reach her. The body-switching
        stops as inexplicably as it started.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taki, Okudera, and his classmate Tsukasa Fujii travel to Hida to search
        for Mitsuha.[h] As Taki does not know the name of her village, he
        sketches its landscape from memory. A ramen-shop owner in Takayama
        recognizes the town as Itomori and offers to take the trio there. When
        they arrive, they find the town completely in ruins (with Mitsuha's
        messages simultaneously vanishing from his phone), having been almost
        entirely decimated by fragments that fell from Tiamat. Since the comet
        passed three years earlier, Taki realizes that he and Mitsuha were
        separated by three years, with her living in 2013 and him in 2016. At
        Hida City Library, the three discover that Mitsuha, her family members,
        and friends were among the five-hundred victims killed by the comet's
        impact. Taki then begins to lose his memories of Mitsuha. Frantically,
        Taki leaves his inn accommodation[i] and rushes to the shrine at
        Goshintai to imbibe Mitsuha's kuchikamizake. Upon doing so, he faints,
        undergoing a vision chronicling much of her life, and realizes that she
        once came to Tokyo to find him.[j] Although he was unaware of whom she
        was, she passed her crimson kumihimo braid to him, which he has worn as
        a good-luck bracelet ever since. He then awakens in Mitsuha's body on
        the morning of the festival.[k] Hitoha undergoes an epiphany upon
        observing "Mitsuha's" uncharacteristic behavior; speaking directly to
        Taki, she reveals that the body-switching phenomenon has been in their
        family for centuries. Realizing he has a chance to save Mitsuha and the
        entire town, Taki convinces Mitsuha's friends, Sayaka and Tessie, to
        assist in broadcasting an emergency signal to evacuate Itomori before
        the meteor fragments strike. He then rushes to the shrine, where Mitsuha
        has just woken up in Taki's body. As twilight falls,[note 3] their
        timelines intersect, allowing them to finally meet in person. Taki
        returns Mitsuha's braid, and they attempt to write their names on each
        other's palms, but twilight ends before Mitsuha can write hers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Returning to Itomori by foot, Mitsuha observes that the evacuation plan
        had failed. She then successfully convinces the mayor, her estranged
        father Toshiki, to order an evacuation drill. Beginning to forget Taki,
        she discovers that he had written "I love you" on her hand instead of
        his name.[note 4] Taki awakens in his own time with no memory of
        Mitsuha.[l] Five years later, Taki, who has graduated from university,
        struggles to find a job: he is haunted by persistent feelings of longing
        and emptiness.[m] He has continuously fixated on the impact of Tiamat,
        from which the residents of Itomori were miraculously saved by a
        fortuitous evacuation drill, but is unable to determine why. Eventually,
        on April 8, 2022, he glimpses Mitsuha, who has moved to Tokyo, on a
        parallel metro train, and they race to find each other. On the steps of
        Suga Shrine [ja], Taki calls out to Mitsuha, and the two simultaneously
        ask for each other's names, declaiming the film's title (Your Name).

        >
        is a 2022 Japanese animated coming-of-age fantasy adventure film written
        and directed by Makoto Shinkai. The third and final installment of
        Shinkai's disaster trilogy, following Your Name (2016) and Weathering
        with You (2019), the film follows 17-year-old high school girl Suzume
        Iwato and young stranger Souta Munakata, who team up to prevent a series
        of disasters across Japan by sealing doors from the colossal,
        supernatural worm that causes earthquakes after being released. Produced
        by CoMix Wave Films, it features the voices of Nanoka Hara and Hokuto
        Matsumura, with character designs by Masayoshi Tanaka, animation
        direction by Kenichi Tsuchiya, art direction by Takumi Tanji, and its
        musical score was composed by Radwimps and Kazuma Jinnouchi, making it
        Shinkai's third collaboration with Tanaka and Radwimps. The film began
        production in early 2020, eventually being announced as completed by
        October 2022. Its themes were inspired by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and
        tsunami. A novel adaptation, also written by Shinkai, and a manga series
        illustrated by Denki Amashima both debuted prior to the film's release.
        Suzume first premiered in IMAX in Japan on November 7, 2022, followed by
        a theatrical release by Toho on November 11. It received largely
        positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards the
        characters, animation, visuals, music, and emotional story. The film
        grossed over US$314 million worldwide, making it the fourth
        highest-grossing Japanese film of all time as well as the fourth
        highest-grossing film of 2022 in Japan. Among its numerous accolades,
        the film was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 81st Golden
        Globe Awards and received seven nominations at the 51st Annie Awards
        losing to both The Boy and the Heron (2023) and Spider-Man: Across the
        Spider-Verse (2023) respectively.

      <strong>Plot: </strong>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Suzume Iwato is a high-school girl living with her aunt Tamaki in a town
        in Kyushu. She has recurring dreams of her childhood self walking
        through a ruined cityscape at night, before running into a shadowy
        figure resembling her late mother. On her way to school one morning,
        Suzume meets a young man searching for abandoned locations with doors,
        and tells him of a nearby abandoned onsen resort. Following him there,
        Suzume discovers a free-standing door, which she opens to find a starlit
        field that she cannot enter. She trips over a cat statue on the floor,
        which turns into a real cat and flees. Frightened, Suzume rushes to
        school. During lunch, Suzume notices a huge column of smoke from the
        location of the abandoned resort, which no one else can see. She returns
        there and finds the man from earlier struggling to close the door
        through which the smoke is escaping. Suzume helps him lock the door with
        an old key. The smoke disappears, but not before causing earthquake
        damage to the town.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suzume takes the injured man, Souta Munakata, to her home. He explains
        that he is a "Closer" and must locate and lock specific doors in
        abandoned places throughout Japan to prevent a supernatural "worm" from
        being released and causing earthquakes. As they talk, the cat from the
        resort appears and turns Souta into the chair he was sitting on. Souta,
        now an animated three-legged chair, chases the cat onto a ferry headed
        for Ehime, with Suzume following. Souta tells Suzume that the cat is a
        "keystone", and that the worm was released after the keystone's removal
        from the resort door. Upon reaching Ehime, Suzume and Souta find social
        media posts from locals, who have photographed and named the cat
        "Daijin". They locate the worm again and close the door it is escaping
        from in an abandoned school. Suzume and Souta hitch a ride to Kobe, and
        Daijin leads them to an abandoned amusement park, where they stop the
        worm from emerging again through a Ferris wheel gondola. Souta explains
        that the portal within the doors leads to the Ever-After, where souls go
        after death.
      </p>
      <p>
        After tracking Daijin to Tokyo, Souta asks Suzume to take them to his
        apartment. He explains the legend of the worm, and that he is the last
        descendant of a family that, for generations, had been responsible for
        locking doors which lead to the Ever-After. Souta speaks of two
        keystones that seal the worm: the western keystone has become Daijin,
        while the location of the eastern keystone is unknown. He warns that if
        the worm tries to emerge in Tokyo, it could cause damage similar to the
        1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. Suzume notices the worm emerging again, and
        the two head towards it. Daijin reappears and reveals that he has passed
        on his function as keystone to Souta. Souta suddenly turns into the new
        keystone and Suzume reluctantly uses him to seal the worm. Awakening at
        a shrine housing the Tokyo gate, Suzume sees Souta within the Ever-After
        but is unable to enter. Suzume visits Souta's grandfather Hitsujir≈ç at
        the hospital, hoping to discover how to rescue Souta. Hitsujir≈ç explains
        that Suzume's ability to see the worm and the Ever-After through the
        doors means that at some point in her life she entered the realm through
        one such door. Moreover, the doorway she first used is the only place
        where she can re-enter the Ever-After.

        highest grossing basketball film of all time.The film follows Ryota
        Miyagi, the point guard of Shohoku High School's basketball team. He had
        a brother, Sota, who was three years older than him and inspired his
        love for basketball. Ryota and his teammates Hanamichi Sakuragi,
        Takenori Akagi, Hisashi Mitsui, and Kaede Rukawa challenge the
        inter-high basketball champions, Sannoh Kogyo High School.[6] The film

      <strong>Plot: </strong>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Hanamichi Sakuragi is a high school delinquent and gang leader. He is
        very unpopular among girls, having been rejected fifty times. In his
        first year at Shohoku High School, Sakuragi meets Haruko Akagi, the girl
        of his dreams, and is overjoyed when she is not repulsed or frightened
        of him like other girls. Haruko recognizes Sakuragi's athleticism and
        introduces him to the Shohoku basketball team. Sakuragi is reluctant to
        play basketball due to his inexperience with sports and his belief that
        basketball is a game for losers. This belief came about because the most
        recent girl to reject him had favored a basketball player. Despite his
        immaturity and temper, he joins the team to impress Haruko, and proves
        to be a natural athlete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sakuragi later develops a genuine love for the sport despite initially
        playing because of his crush. Around this time, the star rookie and
        "girl magnet" Kaede Rukawa joins the team. Sakuragi views him as a
        bitter rival in basketball and romance, as Haruko has an unrequited
        crush on Rukawa. Shortly after, two additional members rejoin the team:
        Hisashi Mitsui, a skilled three-point shooter and ex‚Äìjunior high school
        MVP; and Ryota Miyagi, a short but fast point guard. The four players
        work together to fulfill team captain Takenori Akagi's dream of winning
        the national championship. After defeating one of the powerhouse teams
        at the national high school championship, the misfits gain publicity,
        and the once little-known Shohoku basketball team becomes an all-star
        contender in Japan.
